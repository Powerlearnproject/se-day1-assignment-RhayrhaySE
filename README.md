#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1950s-1960s: Birth of Programming Languages & Software Engineering
Fortran (1957)-The first high-level programming language, developed by IBM for scientific computing. COBOL (1959): Designed for business applications, focusing on readability and portability.Software Engineering (1968): Recognized as a formal discipline during the NATO Software Engineering Conference, addressing the "software crisis."
1970s: Structured Programming & Operating Systems
C Language (1972)-Developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs, laying the foundation for UNIX and modern programming.Structured Programming: Promoted by Edsger Dijkstra, emphasizing clear control structures over unstructured "spaghetti code."UNIX (1970s): A portable, multi-user OS that influenced modern OS design.1980s-1990s: Object-Oriented Programming & Internet Boom
C++ (1985): Introduced object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
Java (1995): A major step in cross-platform development with the "write once, run anywhere" philosophy.The World Wide Web (1990): Tim Berners-Lee developed HTML, HTTP, and the first web browser.
2000s-Present: Agile, Cloud Computing, & AI
Agile Manifesto (2001): Shifted software development from rigid methodologies (like Waterfall) to iterative, user-focused approaches.
Cloud Computing (2000s): AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure revolutionized software deployment and scalability.
AI & Machine Learning (2010s-Present): Languages like Python surged in popularity due to AI, data science, and automation.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology follows a sequential approach, where development progresses through distinct phases: requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. For example, in regulatory or compliance-driven industries such as healthcare or aerospace, software development must adhere to strict standards. A project like developing medical device software for FDA approval would benefit from Waterfall, as it ensures thorough documentation and testing before release. 

In contrast, the Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach that embraces flexibility and continuous improvement. Instead of following a strict sequence, Agile development occurs in short cycles, known as sprints, where teams frequently reassess and refine the product based on user feedback. This methodology is ideal for projects where requirements are likely to evolve, such as software for startups or dynamic industries. For instance, a tech company developing a mobile app may start with a basic version and continuously update it based on user feedback, ensuring that new features align with market demands. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer writes code and implements software solutions.
A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. An example of IDEs is Visual Studio, Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Example of VCS is Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements- Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines- Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt-Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
The different types of testinf include:
Unit Testing-Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing-Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing- Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing-Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance of quality assurance is to help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. The importance of prompt engineering in AI models is to get clear and specific answers to the questions asked. It helps eliminate confusion.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: explain technology
Clear prompt: write a 1000 word article explaining why technology is important in healthcare systems focusing on treatment planning and patient care.
The immproved prompt is clear and gives clear area of focus- technology in healthcare systems instead of technology.
It is specific-outlines specific areas of healthcare that need to be covered which is treatment planning and patient care. 
It is concise-It is easy and straight to the point making the author expect specific results.
